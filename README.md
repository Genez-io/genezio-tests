# End-to-End tests documentation

To run the integration tests you have to:

1. Export a token on the GENEZIO_TOKEN env variable
2. Run `python test_all` to run all tests.

To run an individual test you can just run `python test_hello.py`.

The end to end tests are executed daily on the dev environment. If you want to manually start the test suite you can do that from the Github Actions page.
